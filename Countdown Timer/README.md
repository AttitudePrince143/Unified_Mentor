Project Title: Countdown Timer Web Application

Overview:
----------
This project is a responsive and interactive Countdown Timer web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The main purpose of the app is to allow users to set a future date and time, and watch the timer count down in real-time until that moment is reached.

Key Features:
-------------
✅ Users can create multiple countdown timers.  
✅ Each timer runs independently and displays time in Days, Hours, Minutes, and Seconds.  
✅ When a timer reaches zero, a beep sound is played and a visual flash highlights the timer box.  
✅ Clean and modern user interface with subtle CSS animations.

How It Works:
-------------
1. User selects a future date and time using the date-time input field.
2. Upon clicking "Add Countdown", a new timer is generated on the page.
3. The timer updates every second using JavaScript's `setInterval()` method.
4. When the countdown finishes, a notification message appears with sound and visual feedback.

Technologies Used:
------------------
- **HTML5**: Page structure and elements
- **CSS3**: Styling and animations
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Timer functionality, user interaction, DOM manipulation
